# Jonas Blog

Welcome to Jonas Blog! This is a simple blog website designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to Use

1.  **Create Blog Files:**
    *   For each blog post you want to create, you need to create a separate HTML file (e.g., `blog1.html`, `blog2.html`, `my-travels.html`, etc.).
    *   These files should contain the content of your blog posts.
    *   Make sure to use proper HTML structure in each of your blog files.

2.  **Link Blogs in `index.html`:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file.
    *   Add a link to each of your blog files. This is how you will navigate from the main page to your blog posts.
    *   Each link should be in the format:
```
html
    <a href="blog1.html">My First Blog Post</a>
    
```
Replace `blog1.html` with the actual filename of your blog post, and "My First Blog Post" with the title of your blog.

3.  **Place Files in the `JONASBLOG` Folder:**
    *   Make sure that all your HTML files (`index.html`, `blog1.html`, `blog2.html`, etc.) are in the `JONASBLOG` folder.
    * The CSS file has to be in the same folder as well.
    * When you add a new blog, the blog file needs to be created in this folder.

## Example

If you create a blog post called `my-trip-to-italy.html`, you would add the following to your `index.html`:
```
html
<a href="my-trip-to-italy.html">My Trip to Italy</a>
```
## Getting Started

1.  Start by creating your first blog post file (e.g., `blog1.html`).
2.  Write your blog content in that file.
3.  Add a link to that file in `index.html`.
4.  Repeat for each new blog post.

Have fun blogging!
